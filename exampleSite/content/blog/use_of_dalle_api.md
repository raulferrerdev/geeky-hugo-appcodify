#### Introduction
<!--{{< youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc >}}-->
Surely you have heard of, and have even tried, an Artificial Intelligence that allows you to generate images from text. This is the case of DALL-E.

**DALL-E** is a deep learning model called created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) can produce images from textual descriptions. It was first described in a 2021 academic paper and has since attracted a lot of interest for its capacity to produce a wide variety of very realistic images from a wide range of input descriptions.

**DALL-E** is trained on a sizable dataset of text-image pairs and is built on a transformer architecture. It may then produce images based on a given textual description after using this training data to learn the relationship between text and visuals. **DALL-E** might provide an image of a home that closely resembles the description you give it, such as "a white horse jumping over a wooden fence."

**DALL-E**'s capacity to produce images that are not only realistic but also original and creative is one of its primary characteristics. It has the capacity to produce a wide variety of previously unseen visuals, including pictures of things and scenes that don't actually exist.

#### DALL-E API Key
Developers can access and use the DALL-E model in their own apps by using the API that OpenAI provides for it. Developers can send a written description to **DALL-E** and get an image in reply by using the API. The API is easily incorporated into a number of applications and is accessed through a straightforward RESTful interface.
