An iOS app can exist in multiple states, each with its own set of features and behaviors. **Not running**, **inactive**, **active**, **background**, and **suspended** are some of these states.

When an app is **not running**, no code is being executed and it is not visible to the user. This state can occur when an app is first installed and not yet launched, or when the system terminates an app.

When an app is no longer the foreground app but is still executing code, it can transition from the **active** state to the **background** state. This can happen when a user switches to another app or when a system event occurs, such as a phone call. While in the **background**, an app can continue to execute code, but it has limited access to system resources and is not visible to the user.

Finally, an app can enter the **suspended** state if it is no longer executing code and is not visible to the user. The system uses this type of hibernation to conserve resources. A **suspended** app remains in memory but does not consume CPU or other system resources.

Each state has unique characteristics and behaviors, and it is critical for developers to understand these distinctions when creating iOS apps. An app in the **background**, for example, has limited access to system resources, so it is critical to manage those resources carefully. Furthermore, developers should be aware of the various ways in which an app can transition between states and design their apps to handle these transitions smoothly.

## Respond to changes in app state

To respond to changes in an app's state, developers can use the **UIApplicationDelegate** protocol in their app's delegate class. The protocol defines several methods that are called by the system as an app's state changes.

For example, to respond to an app entering the active state, a developer can implement the applicationDidBecomeActive(_:) method in the app's delegate class:

Copy code
func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the active state
}
Similarly, to respond to an app entering the background state, a developer can implement the applicationDidEnterBackground(_:) method:

Copy code
func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the background state
}
To respond to an app entering the inactive state, a developer can implement the applicationWillResignActive(_:) method:

Copy code
func applicationWillResignActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the inactive state
}
To respond to an app entering the suspended state, a developer can implement the applicationDidEnterBackground(_:) method:

Copy code
func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the suspended state
}
It is important to note that the app can only transition to the suspended state if it has not requested any background execution time.

Also, it's worth mentioning that an app can be in the background state but still be running in the background. In this case, the app can use background tasks to perform specific tasks, such as playing music or downloading data. To request background execution time, you can use the beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:) method of the UIApplication class.

It's important to note that these methods are called by the system, and they should be used to handle the app's transition between states and manage resources accordingly.

And in SwiftUI?
In SwiftUI, you can use the onAppear and onDisappear modifiers to respond to changes in an app's state.

For example, to respond to a view appearing on screen, you can use the onAppear modifier:

Copy code
struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .onAppear {
                // Code to execute when the view appears on screen
            }
    }
}
Similarly, to respond to a view disappearing from the screen, you can use the onDisappear modifier:

Copy code
struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .onDisappear {
                // Code to execute when the view disappears from the screen
            }
    }
}
It's worth mentioning that these modifiers are called in response to the view being added to or removed from the view hierarchy, not necessarily with the app's state transitions, but they can be useful to respond to some of them.

Additionally, you can use the SceneDelegate class in your app to respond to app state changes. The SceneDelegate class is responsible for managing the life cycle of a scene and its associated view hierarchy. The class has methods like sceneDidEnterBackground, sceneWillEnterForeground, sceneDidBecomeActive, and sceneWillResignActive which can be overridden to respond to the corresponding state changes.

For example, to respond to an app entering the background state, you can override the sceneDidEnterBackground method in the SceneDelegate class:

Copy code
func sceneDidEnterBackground(_ scene: UIScene) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the background state
}
It's important to note that when using SwiftUI, the SceneDelegate methods are used instead of the AppDelegate methods.

In conclusion, in SwiftUI, you can use the onAppear and onDisappear modifiers to respond to changes in a view's state, and the SceneDelegate class to respond to changes in the app's state.

Conclusion 
In conclusion, an iOS app can exist in several states, including not running, inactive, active, background, and suspended. Each state has its own characteristics and behaviors, and it is important for developers to understand these differences when developing iOS apps. Developers can use the UIApplicationDelegate protocol or the SceneDelegate class in their app's delegate class to respond to changes in an app's state. In SwiftUI, developers can use the onAppear and onDisappear modifiers to respond to changes in a view's state, and the SceneDelegate class to respond to changes in the app's state. It is important to design the app in a way that can handle these transitions smoothly and manage resources accordingly. Understanding these states and how to respond to them is crucial for developing efficient and user-friendly iOS apps.

What is the state of an app in the former context 
In the context of the article, the state of an app refers to the current stage of execution and visibility of the app on an iOS device. The five states of an app discussed in the article are:

Not running: The app is not currently executing any code and is not visible to the user.
Inactive: The app is launched but not currently receiving any events or updates from the system.
Active: The app is running in the foreground, visible to the user and receiving events and updates from the system.
Background: The app is no longer in the foreground but still executing code with limited access to system resources and not visible to the user.
Suspended: The app is no longer executing code, not visible to the user and in a form of hibernation preserving resources.
These different states have different characteristics and behaviors, and developers need to understand them to design efficient and user-friendly iOS apps.
