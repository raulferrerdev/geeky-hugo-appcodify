An iOS app can exist in several states, each with its own unique characteristics and behaviors. These states include not running, inactive, active, background, and suspended.

When an app is not running, it is not currently executing any code and is not visible to the user. This state can occur when an app is first installed and has not yet been launched, or when an app is terminated by the system.

An app can transition from the not running state to the inactive state when it is launched by the user. In this state, the app is still executing code, but it is not currently receiving any events or updates from the system. This can occur when an app is launched but not yet visible to the user, such as when a user is presented with a login screen before the main app interface is displayed.

The active state is the state in which an app is running in the foreground and is visible to the user. In this state, the app is receiving events and updates from the system and is able to interact with the user. This is the state in which an app typically spends the majority of its time.

An app can transition from the active state to the background state when it is no longer the foreground app but is still executing code. This can occur when a user switches to another app or when a system event, such as a phone call, occurs. While in the background, an app can continue to execute code, but it has limited access to system resources and is not visible to the user.

Finally, an app can transition to the suspended state when it is no longer executing code and is not visible to the user. This state is a form of hibernation and is used by the system to preserve resources. An app in the suspended state remains in memory but is not consuming CPU or other system resources.

Each state has its own characteristics and behaviors, and it is important for developers to understand these differences when developing iOS apps. For example, an app in the background state has limited access to system resources, so it is important to manage those resources carefully. Additionally, developers should be aware of the different ways that an app can transition between states, and they should design their apps to handle these transitions smoothly.

Code for doing task on entering those states
To respond to changes in an app's state, developers can use the UIApplicationDelegate protocol in their app's delegate class. The protocol defines several methods that are called by the system as an app's state changes.

For example, to respond to an app entering the active state, a developer can implement the applicationDidBecomeActive(_:) method in the app's delegate class:

Copy code
func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the active state
}
Similarly, to respond to an app entering the background state, a developer can implement the applicationDidEnterBackground(_:) method:

Copy code
func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the background state
}
To respond to an app entering the inactive state, a developer can implement the applicationWillResignActive(_:) method:

Copy code
func applicationWillResignActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the inactive state
}
To respond to an app entering the suspended state, a developer can implement the applicationDidEnterBackground(_:) method:

Copy code
func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the suspended state
}
It is important to note that the app can only transition to the suspended state if it has not requested any background execution time.

Also, it's worth mentioning that an app can be in the background state but still be running in the background. In this case, the app can use background tasks to perform specific tasks, such as playing music or downloading data. To request background execution time, you can use the beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:) method of the UIApplication class.

It's important to note that these methods are called by the system, and they should be used to handle the app's transition between states and manage resources accordingly.

And in SwiftUI?
In SwiftUI, you can use the onAppear and onDisappear modifiers to respond to changes in an app's state.

For example, to respond to a view appearing on screen, you can use the onAppear modifier:

Copy code
struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .onAppear {
                // Code to execute when the view appears on screen
            }
    }
}
Similarly, to respond to a view disappearing from the screen, you can use the onDisappear modifier:

Copy code
struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .onDisappear {
                // Code to execute when the view disappears from the screen
            }
    }
}
It's worth mentioning that these modifiers are called in response to the view being added to or removed from the view hierarchy, not necessarily with the app's state transitions, but they can be useful to respond to some of them.

Additionally, you can use the SceneDelegate class in your app to respond to app state changes. The SceneDelegate class is responsible for managing the life cycle of a scene and its associated view hierarchy. The class has methods like sceneDidEnterBackground, sceneWillEnterForeground, sceneDidBecomeActive, and sceneWillResignActive which can be overridden to respond to the corresponding state changes.

For example, to respond to an app entering the background state, you can override the sceneDidEnterBackground method in the SceneDelegate class:

Copy code
func sceneDidEnterBackground(_ scene: UIScene) {
    // Code to execute when the app enters the background state
}
It's important to note that when using SwiftUI, the SceneDelegate methods are used instead of the AppDelegate methods.

In conclusion, in SwiftUI, you can use the onAppear and onDisappear modifiers to respond to changes in a view's state, and the SceneDelegate class to respond to changes in the app's state.

Conclusion 
In conclusion, an iOS app can exist in several states, including not running, inactive, active, background, and suspended. Each state has its own characteristics and behaviors, and it is important for developers to understand these differences when developing iOS apps. Developers can use the UIApplicationDelegate protocol or the SceneDelegate class in their app's delegate class to respond to changes in an app's state. In SwiftUI, developers can use the onAppear and onDisappear modifiers to respond to changes in a view's state, and the SceneDelegate class to respond to changes in the app's state. It is important to design the app in a way that can handle these transitions smoothly and manage resources accordingly. Understanding these states and how to respond to them is crucial for developing efficient and user-friendly iOS apps.

What is the state of an app in the former context 
In the context of the article, the state of an app refers to the current stage of execution and visibility of the app on an iOS device. The five states of an app discussed in the article are:

Not running: The app is not currently executing any code and is not visible to the user.
Inactive: The app is launched but not currently receiving any events or updates from the system.
Active: The app is running in the foreground, visible to the user and receiving events and updates from the system.
Background: The app is no longer in the foreground but still executing code with limited access to system resources and not visible to the user.
Suspended: The app is no longer executing code, not visible to the user and in a form of hibernation preserving resources.
These different states have different characteristics and behaviors, and developers need to understand them to design efficient and user-friendly iOS apps.
