title: "Async/Await use in Swift and SwiftUI"
description: "Async/await is a language feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-looking style. It makes it easier to write and read code that performs tasks concurrently, without using complex callback functions. This can lead to more efficient and responsive programs, as well as a better developer experience."

A language feature called **async/await**,0 enables you to construct asynchronous code that seems to be synchronous. It enables concurrent task execution without the use of convoluted callback procedures, making concurrent task execution code easier to create and read.

Utilizing **async/await** has a number of advantages, one of which is that it makes your software more effective and responsive. When you utilize **async/await**, you may create programs that conduct time-consuming processes in the background while letting the main thread carry on. This guarantees that your software will remain responsive while it waits for a task to finish, which can be crucial in user-facing apps.

**Async/await** can enhance the developer experience in addition to making your code more effective and responsive. Developers used to writing synchronous code will find it easier to grasp and more familiar to create asynchronous code in this manner. This may lessen the learning curve for dealing with asynchronous code and facilitate developers' assimilation.
